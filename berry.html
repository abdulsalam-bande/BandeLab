    <h1>Berry: Enhancing Health Access with AI</h1>
    <div class="card-row">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>What Berry Does</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Berry</strong> is a mobile application I designed to address the critical challenge of limited
                healthcare access in underdeveloped regions by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). With an
                intuitive interface and multilingual support, Berry delivers personalised diet, exercise, and health
                recommendations by analysing a user’s medical records, activity data, and contextual information from
                connected devices like smartwatches and smart scales.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of a recent pilot program involving 83 participants, over <strong>85% rated Berry’s
                recommendations 4 or 5 stars</strong> in terms of usefulness, reliability, and clarity. The app's
                success demonstrates how mobile-first AI solutions can democratise healthcare delivery, especially in
                regions like Nigeria, where the doctor-to-patient ratio is as low as 3.8 per 10,000 individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can chat with the model, receive flashcard-based health awareness tips, and log meals, symptoms,
                and test results directly within the app. Berry also integrates with platforms such as Apple Health and
                MyFitnessPal to enhance its contextual accuracy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                Berry was developed with adaptability in mind — its modular design supports switching between different
                LLMs and ensures user privacy by limiting data sharing with third parties. Though GPT-4o was used during
                the pilot for its power and context length, the architecture is future-ready for on-device models as
                mobile hardware advances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participants' data, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, sleep patterns, and dietary logs, were
                compiled to personalise health suggestions. A comprehensive survey revealed not only high user
                engagement but also a meaningful improvement in users' health awareness — a key step toward long-term
                behaviour change and self-care.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>A Stepping Stone Toward My Research Journey</h3>
            <p>
                Berry is more than just a mobile app — it's a manifestation of my research vision: applying machine
                learning to solve real-world problems that matter. My goal is to explore the intersection of
                personalised AI, computational health, and mobile-first interventions during my PhD studies. I believe
                Berry lays a strong foundation for this path, showcasing both technical rigour and societal relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I continue to refine the app and publish its outcomes, I aim to collaborate with NGOs, integrate
                standalone diagnostic models, and scale Berry to a wider demographic.
