Attending AI_dev Europe 2025 in Amsterdam was my first experience at a major international technology conference. It provided me with the opportunity to step into the wider AI industry and see how companies of all sizes approach the challenges of building, deploying, and scaling models responsibly. One theme that came up repeatedly in conversations was data. When I asked engineers and researchers about their biggest challenges, nearly all pointed to data quality, acquisition, and governance rather than model design itself. The message was clear: without disciplined data practices, even the most advanced algorithms struggle to deliver value.
Another important observation was the widespread reliance on open-source models, particularly from providers like Hugging Face. Few organisations train large models entirely from scratch; instead, they adapt publicly available models to fit their needs. This trend underlines the growing significance of the open-source ecosystem, which has become central to accelerating the field. It was encouraging to see how both start-ups and established firms treat open tooling not just as a cost-saver but as a foundation of modern AI work.

Among the talks, three stood out. Dr Jennifer Prendki’s keynote explored whether the industry is ready for the next compute revolution, making the case for preparing today’s machine learning operations for a future where quantum computing could play a role. For me, this was especially exciting: even before the release of GPT-3 in 2022 I had been a firm believer in AI and its potential. Now I see quantum computation as the next major step, and hearing Dr Prendki speak to that belief made the moment feel both personal and inspiring. It also made me reflect on the sufficiency of current research in quantum computing. I believe introductory courses in this area should become part of computer science curricula to accelerate progress in the field.
Verena Dittmer of Canva shared lessons on building for speed, showing that it is possible to empower rapid research without sacrificing engineering discipline. Emmanouil “Manos” Koukoumidis argued for strengthening the open-source AI movement to prevent power from concentrating in only a handful of firms—a perspective that strongly resonated with me after hearing how many teams depend on shared models.

For me, the value of AI_dev Europe was beyond the scheduled programme. It was in the informal exchanges, the chance to ask quick questions, compare notes, and see how peers are thinking about the same problems I face in my day-to-day work. I left with new insights, a stronger sense of where the industry is heading, and fresh motivation to bring these lessons back to my own projects.
